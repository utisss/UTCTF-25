This is a picture of the Norman Hackerman building. It should be pretty easy to locate.

If they know the location but aren't getting the flag right, make sure they're in the right place (it should be the location from the perspective of the camera taking the picture)

It doesn't have to be exact, I set it to accept all 4 blocks adjacent to where the picture was taken
